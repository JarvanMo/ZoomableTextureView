ZoomableTextureView
-------

Enables pinch to zoom and scroll gestures on video while it's playing. Can be used with MediaPlayer and the new ExoPlayer API. Inspired by similar implementation for ImageView http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6650398/android-imageview-zoom-in-and-zoom-out

![](https://github.com/Manuiq/ZoomableTextureView/raw/master/example.gif)

Usage
-------

Just include the custom view in your XML layout:
```xml
    <ua.polohalo.zoomabletextureview.ZoomableTextureView
        android:id="@+id/textureView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:maxScale="6" />
```

 **app:maxScale="6"** determines that the max zooming factor will be 600%.

In case you want to use it with the new SimpleExoPlayerView instead of ExoPlayer(provides controls out of the box) there is a sample on how to do just that [here.](https://github.com/Manuiq/ZoomableTextureView/blob/master/app/src/main/java/ua/polohalo/zoomabletextureview/sample/ZoomableExoPlayerView.java)
